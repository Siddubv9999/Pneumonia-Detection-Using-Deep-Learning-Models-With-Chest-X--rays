# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Models-With-Chest-X--rays
This project uses deep learning models like DenseNet201, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 to detect pneumonia from chest X-rays. Trained on 5,947 images, DenseNet201 achieved 97% accuracy. The system shows promise for accurate, AI-based diagnosis in medical imaging, especially in low-resource settings.
